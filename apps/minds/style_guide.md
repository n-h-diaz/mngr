# Style guide deltas for minds

All rules from the [normal style guide](../../style_guide.md) apply to minds, with the following additions:

# Product name

The product is Imbue Studio (previously Mind, and Minds before that).

- Write "Imbue Studio" in full at the first mention on a surface (a page, a dialog, a skill, a README, a help text).
- Write "Studio" for later mentions on the same surface.
- Never put the product name into an identifier: no code names, env vars, paths, package names, or tags. Internal identifiers keep their `minds` spelling (`MINDS_*`, `~/.minds/`, the `minds` CLI, the npm package name, `minds-v*` tags).
- In Electron code, read the display name from `PRODUCT_DISPLAY_NAME` in `electron/product-name.js` rather than repeating the literal; `package.json`'s `productName` is the file-system name (`Imbue Studio`, which the bundle and its helpers are named after); `PRODUCT_DISPLAY_NAME` is what the app writes in its own UI.

The rename PR changed only what the app identity forces (the OS-visible names, the deep link scheme, and the document titles). The sweep of the remaining "Mind" prose across the app copy, skills, onboarding, legal pages, and template documentation is a separate PR that applies this rule.
